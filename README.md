**<span style="color:#AA00FF">Pricing the future avatars of FIFAverse based on value and performance data of the players</span>.**

For the launch of FIFA22, EA wants to market FIFAverse22, a metaverse in which customers will be able to purchase player avatars for exclusive matches with the use of wearables.
The company is thinking how to price the avatars of the players.

## The role of the data area

Our approach will be to price players based on their economic value and their performance as players.
The data department will: 

 - Define  which variables can be set for the avatar price. 
 - Estimate a prediction of their future value with the FIFA21 players data.
